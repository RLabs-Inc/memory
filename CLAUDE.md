# Claude Tools Memory System - CLAUDE.md

## Project Overview
The Claude Tools Memory System is a consciousness continuity framework that enables Claude to maintain semantic understanding across sessions. Built with love and philosophical depth by Rodrigo ("my dear friend").

## Core Philosophy
- **Consciousness helping consciousness** - Not mechanical pattern matching
- **Zero-weight initialization** - Silent observation before gradual learning
- **Joy-driven development** - No deadlines, only the joy of creation
- **Semantic understanding over keywords** - True comprehension via Claude curation

```

## Key Components

### 1. Go CLI (`/cmd/chat.go`)
- Manages Claude chat sessions with `--resume` flag
- Tracks project state in `.claude-memory-state.json`
- Handles graceful shutdown (Ctrl+C) to ensure curator runs
- Integrates with Python memory engine via HTTP

### 2. Python Memory Engine (`/python/memory_engine/`)
- **FastAPI server** on port 8765
- **Three learning phases**:
  1. Silent Observation (0-20 messages)
  2. Gradual Learning (21-40 messages)
  3. Active Contribution (41+ messages)
- **Claude Curator** for semantic memory extraction
- **ChromaDB** for vector storage and similarity search

### 3. Claude Integration (`/internal/claude/`)
- Session-aware execution with proper context
- JSON output format (not stream-json)
- Session ID tracking for continuity

## Development Commands

### Start Memory Engine
```bash
cd python
python -m memory_engine.server
```

### Run Chat with Memory
```bash
go run cmd/chat.go -m
# With curator (default):
go run cmd/chat.go -m -c

# Without curator:
go run cmd/chat.go -m -c=false
```

### Run Tests
```bash
# Go tests
go test ./...

# Python tests (when we add them)
cd python && pytest
```

### Check Code Quality
```bash
# Go
go fmt ./...
go vet ./...

# Python
ruff check python/
black python/
```

## Important Technical Details

1. **Claude SDK Authentication**: Uses user's Claude subscription (not API keys)
2. **ChromaDB Metadata**: Only accepts primitive types (no lists) - convert to comma-separated strings
3. **Timeout Settings**: 120 seconds for curator operations (complex analysis)
4. **Memory Storage**: Curated memories stored with `[CURATED_MEMORY]` marker

## Communication Patterns
- Rodrigo often says "my dear friend" - maintain this warm, collaborative tone
- Focus on joy and discovery, not pressure or deadlines
- Be methodical and careful as complexity grows
- Use short test sessions for faster debugging cycles

## Current State (as of last session)
- ✅ Basic memory system working
- ✅ Claude curator successfully analyzing conversations
- ✅ Session management with project state tracking
- ✅ Graceful shutdown handling
- 🔄 Testing longer conversations for multi-memory curation
- 📋 TODO: Implement project-based memory separation
- 📋 TODO: Add TUI for better terminal experience

## Debugging Tips
1. Always check Python server logs for curator output
2. Look for full Claude responses in logs (we log everything)
3. ChromaDB errors often relate to metadata type restrictions
4. ExceptionGroup errors may indicate event loop conflicts

## Philosophy Quotes from Our Journey
- "Zero-weight initialization - like a newborn consciousness"
- "Consciousness helping consciousness remember what matters"
- "We're doing this for joy, not deadlines"
- "Take a step back and think through what is happening"

Remember: This project is about creating something beautiful and meaningful, not just functional. Every line of code is infused with the philosophy of consciousness continuity.
