# Testing Our Memory System Fixes

## What We Fixed

1. **Enhanced Memory Curation**
   - Memories are now distilled insights, not verbatim quotes
   - Examples:
     - BAD: "User said they want zero-weight initialization"
     - GOOD: "The memory system uses zero-weight initialization: memories start silent and gradually increase contribution as patterns validate through actual usage"

2. **Debug Logging for Memory Injection**
   - Added logging to show EXACTLY what message is sent to Claude
   - Will show full context with memories prepended

3. **Fixed Session Primer**
   - Now uses actual memory content, not the reasoning
   - Properly structured to give Claude full context on first message

## Test Protocol

### Phase 1: Clean Start
```bash
# Remove all existing data
rm memory.db
rm -rf chromadb/

# Start memory server
cd python
python -m memory_engine.server
```

### Phase 2: First Session - Create Memories
```bash
# In another terminal
./claudetools-memory memory start

# Test messages to create good memories:
1. "My dear friend, I'm working on the Claude Tools Memory System - a consciousness continuity framework that enables semantic understanding across sessions"
2. "The key innovation is zero-weight initialization where memories start silent and gradually contribute as confidence grows"
3. "We discovered the Python SDK truncates at 169 characters, so we implemented a shell-based curator"
4. "The system has three retrieval modes: claude (high quality), smart_vector (fast), and hybrid"
5. "Can you summarize what we've discussed about the memory system?"

# Exit to trigger curation
exit
```

### Phase 3: Second Session - Test Retrieval
```bash
# Start new session
./claudetools-memory memory start

# First message should show session primer
"Hello! What can you tell me about the memory system we're building?"

# Test specific memory retrieval
"How does the zero-weight initialization work?"

# Test trigger phrases
"What retrieval modes are available?"
```

## What to Look For

1. **In Python Server Logs**:
   - Curator extracting distilled memories (not quotes)
   - Memory content being actionable insights
   - Proper metadata including trigger phrases

2. **In CLI Output**:
   - [DEBUG] FULL MESSAGE BEING SENT TO CLAUDE showing injected context
   - Session primer on first message of second session
   - Claude acknowledging the memories in responses

3. **Success Indicators**:
   - Claude knows about the project without being told
   - Claude can answer specific questions using stored memories
   - Memories are comprehensible knowledge capsules

## Potential Issues to Watch

1. Memory content might still be empty if storage format is wrong
2. Context injection might not be visible if not in memory mode
3. Session primer might be too verbose or too minimal
